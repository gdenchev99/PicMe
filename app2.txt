Traveling/Partying with random people.


People can create travel "parties" and decide how many members can join.

They can choose what destinations they are going to visit.

They can pick which hotels they are going to stay at during their travels.

Random people can request to join said group. They can reserve one or a few spots(if they are family).

The needed budget is set by the owner on the "party". Budget is per member.
It includes hotel, sites(for example museum). 

Money for tickets(plane) and food(outside of the hotel) are not included. Each person should bring as much as they think they need. The party owner can set a recomended budget for souvenirs, food, etc.

Once a member requests to join a group, and they are accepted, they have a limited time(set by the party owner) in which they should deposit the needed budget. Their places in the party will then be considered "reserved".

Once the day for the trip arrives, each member/family will have an option to share their location over the app, thus the other members know where each one of them is.

Private/Public parties.
